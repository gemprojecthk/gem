Emerald

Famous for its rich green colors, the emerald was first discovered in Egypt and was known to be the favorite stone of Cleopatra. The most beautiful emeralds are found in Colombia and Zambia. Emeralds can also be found in Pakistan, Brazil, Zimbabwe, and Russia. Even though this stone measures highly on hardness, this stone ranks fair to poor in toughness so it must be worn with extra care!
